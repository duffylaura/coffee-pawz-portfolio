# Coffee Pawz's Portfolio 

## Description 

This Portfolio web application uses React to render content and is deployed to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages npm package. The application uses a single Header component, with a Navigation component, and a single Footer component. The Navigation component allows the user to click on tabs (for example, "Portfolio") that will then conditionally render that section. The Portfolio section makes use of a Project Component that is used multiple times. 

The User Experience is intuitive and easy to navigate; the User Interface style is clean and polished, using a rainbow accented color scheme with a kawaii aesthetic.

## Code Snippets
The Contact Form uses EmailJS to forward emails to the developers email address. EmailJS is a JavaScript library rhtat helps send emails using only client-side technologies. To install the EmailJS package the developer uses the `npm i emailjs-com` in their CLI. They then connect their email account to EmailJS and connect their EmailJS account within their code, as can be seen below.
