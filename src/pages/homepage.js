  about: 'Did you listen to a song today that made you feel a certain way, but want to express it in a new and fun way? Do you want to join a community of like-minded music lovers? If yes, Then Purple wAIve is perfect for you! Purple wAIve is a webpage built for audiophiles, artists, writers or really anyone who likes music and artistic expression. Purple wAIve uses DALLE2s artificial intelligence system to generate pictures based on user input.The AI generated images offer an expansion of the scope of artistic expression since most humans would not think to create an image/picture the same as an AI system that has millions and millions of pictures/images to reference all at a moments notice.',

This application focuses on the backend for a social network and therefore has not been deployed. It can be installed following the instructions in the README.',
